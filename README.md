# Final Project Ideas



## Shooter game
A game where there is a main character with a gun who shoots enemies. It will move from left to right.
The character can move forward, jump, and shoot.

## Basketball game
User will aim at a basket and choose how hard (s)he wants to throw it with a power meter.

## Fly game
A character will fly in the sky and try to avoid objects by moving up or down

## Final Idea - Square Maze
The user will move a square that tries to get to the door at the bottom of the maze. (S)He is forced to stay inide of the lines of the maze and tries to avoid being hit by a big red circle.

There are pockets in the maze walls for the user to "hide" from being hit by the circle.

If the user hits the circle they are relocated to the start.

Every time the user reaches the door they are relocated and the circle is sped up.
